
Growl Plug-In for Pandora AIR Application
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adobe AIR applications don't have a built-in plug-in architecture, but
fortunately, the Pandora AIR application is nothing more than some html pages 
and javascript. Thus the method of adding Growl support involves editing the
main Pandora html page to include some additional Growl javascript.

*** These instructions require overwriting the original Pandora html file - 
*** Install this plug-in at your own risk.

1. Locate the Pandora installation. On Windows, the default location is:
	C:\Program Files\Pandora

2. Copy the included 'growl' folder and all of its contents into the Pandora
   folder.

3. Open the 'html' folder and find the 'Pandora.html' file. Make a backup copy
   of this file before proceeding.

4. Copy the included 'Pandora.html' file into the 'html' folder, overwriting
   the original file.


If the Pandora AIR app is already running, you will have to restart it.


*** If you mess up the main Pandora html file, there is a chance that the 
*** Pandora application will no longer work. If the application no longer loads
*** properly after your edits, restore the original 'Pandora.html' file.

*** These instructions are intended for version 1 of the Pandora AIR
*** application. Other versions may not work with these instructions or the 
*** included Growl javascript files.

*** If you install an update to the Pandora AIR application that overwrites the
*** 'Pandora.html' file, Growl notifications will no longer work. You will have
*** to re-edit the html file in order to include the Growl javascript files.
